    going to learn :: Functions are also value;
                        1.we can save function into var
                        2.we can save funtion inside an obj
                        3.method : fun saved inside an obj
                        4.we can also pass a funtion inside any function as parameter.
                        5.settimeout: it allow fun to run with some delay or in further future.
                         --1.param: fun that would run with delay  SETTIMEOUT(FUNCTION_NAME, TIME IN MILISEC);
                         --2.How long to wait before runnning this function:
                                                                    (a number in millisec) 1000 milisec = 1sec
                        6.Asynchronous code:won't wait for a line to finish 
                                            before going to the next line  
                        7.synchronous code: will wait for one line to finish before going to the 
                                            the next line
                        ****JAVASCRIPT IS SYNCHRONOUS, BLOCKING, SINGLE-THREADED******
                        8.SetInterval(): run in interval, like every 3sec.
                                        setinterval(function, time)
                                toStopInterval: clearInterval(varName or function name);
